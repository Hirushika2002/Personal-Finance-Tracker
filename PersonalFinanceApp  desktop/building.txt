Step 3: Build and Publish with dotnet CLI

    Open a terminal:
        Navigate to the folder where your .csproj file is located.
    Run the following command to publish your app:
COMMAND:
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true /p:PublishSingleFile=true

    -c Release: Builds the application in Release mode.
    -r win-x64: Targets the 64-bit Windows platform (change to win-x86 for 32-bit).
    --self-contained true: Includes the .NET runtime in the build.
    /p:PublishSingleFile=true: Creates a single .exe.
